Articles and blogs Collection which I find very interesting from diverse fields.

* [Securing The Post-Quantum World](https://blog.cloudflare.com/securing-the-post-quantum-world/)<br>

> **To protect today’s data from tomorrow’s quantum adversaries, we need new cryptographic techniques that are not vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm.** <br>
>
> The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is leading the charge in defining post-quantum cryptography algorithms to replace RSA and ECC. There is a project currently underway to test and select a set of post-quantum computing-resistant algorithms that go beyond existing public-key cryptography.

* [How Design Thinking Transformed Airbnb from a Failing Startup to a Billion Dollar Business](https://firstround.com/review/How-design-thinking-transformed-Airbnb-from-failing-startup-to-billion-dollar-business/)

> **You can write one line of code that can solve a problem for one customer, 10,000 or 10 million.** <br>
>
> Graham tossed out a completely non-scalable and non-technical solution to the problem: travel to New York, rent a camera, spend some time with customers listing properties, and replace the amateur photography with beautiful high-resolution pictures.
>
> “Our new designer comes back and says I have it. I go what do you mean you have it? You only spent the day on it. He goes, well, I think the stars are the kinds of things you see in utility-driven experiences. He explained our service is so aspirational. Why don't we tap into that? He goes I'm going to change that to a heart. I go, wow, okay. It's interesting, and we can ship it so we did. When we ship it, we put code in it so we can track it and see how behavior changed.” <br>
> Sure enough, the simple change from a star to a heart increased engagement by over 30%. **In short, let people be pirates, ship stuff and try new things.**

* [Friendship that Made Google Huge](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge)

> When a supernova explodes, the blast wave creates high-energy particles that scatter in every direction; scientists believe there is a minute chance that one of the errant particles, known as a cosmic ray, can hit a computer chip on Earth, flipping a 0 to a 1. The world’s most robust computer systems, at nasa, financial firms, and the like, used special hardware that could tolerate single bit-flips. But Google, which was still operating like a startup, bought cheaper computers that lacked that feature.

* [Must Know Numbers For Every Computer Engineer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/must-know-numbers-for-every-computer-engineer/)

> **So the greater the response size means more bytes, a longer round trip, more API latency, and ultimately a less user friendly app.** <br>
